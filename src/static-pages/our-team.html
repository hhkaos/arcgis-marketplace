<h1>Our team</h1>

<p>
    We have been working with the ArcGIS Platform more than 4 years, and we
    have seen developing storymaps since they were launched. After these
    years we have notice and increasing interest on the use of storymaps and
    given our experience we decided to build this platform to help users to
    build more compelling stories.
